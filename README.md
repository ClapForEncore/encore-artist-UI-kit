# EncoreUI

To use this swiftUI design kit for encore apps, you need to import it in each file where you want to use it

`import EncoreUI`


The package contains useful and time-saving extensions for Encore's custom `Font`, `Image`, `Color` and `View`


Please note: in order to use the custom fonts provided by the package, you need to call `Fonts.registerFonts()` once at app launch
